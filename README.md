kong - Donkey Kong in the terminal, written in Go
-------------------------------------------------

Hello, please ignore this repo for Gopher Gala. Various reasons prevented the
team from putting it a lot of time, and our choice of game style was quite
difficult to implement in termloop, our framework of choice for this challenge.

We still had a good bit of fun and learned some stuff about game programming.
Maybe we will push some stuff up later.
